abstract = "Forty-three normal hearing participants were tested in two experiments, which focused on temporal coincidence in auditory visual (AV) speech perception. In these experiments, audio recordings of/pa/and/ba/were dubbed onto video recordings of /ba/or/ga/, respectively (ApVk, AbVg), to produce the illusory “fusion” percepts /ta/, or /da/ [McGurk, H., & McDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices. Nature, 264, 746–747]. In Experiment 1, an identification task using McGurk pairs with asynchronies ranging from −467ms (auditory lead) to +467ms was conducted. Fusion responses were prevalent over temporal asynchronies from −30ms to +170ms and more robust for audio lags. In Experiment 2, simultaneity judgments for incongruent and congruent audiovisual tokens (AdVd, AtVt) were collected. McGurk pairs were more readily judged as asynchronous than congruent pairs. Characteristics of the temporal window over which simultaneity and fusion responses were maximal were quite similar, suggesting the existence of a 200ms duration asymmetric bimodal temporal integration window."
